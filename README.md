# Duplicate Detection 
### Via Data Similarity Mapping

Due to poor and varied governance across heritage systems, master data was highly inconsistent within and across systems. Differences in encoding conventions complicate the use of out-of-the-box SAP tools for duplicate detection.

The implementation of an unsupervised machine learning model allows duplicate detection without comprehensive (or any) data cleansing on data that may end up being culled or consolidated. This approach is effective for any application in which similar natural language data records need to be grouped together at varying levels of granularity. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This project was coded in Python 2.7 although, with minor modifications, could be run in Python 3.6. The below pre-requisites assume the user has a current version of pip installed. 

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7

```
Python --version
2.7.15
```

pip 

```
pip --version
pip 9.0.3 from c:\python27\lib\site-packages (python 2.7)
```
pip will allow you to easily download all of the dependencies for this code base. pip should install when you download python. However, if it does not, follow the download directions here: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
