# Duplicate Detection 
### Via Data Similarity Mapping

Due to poor and varied governance across heritage systems, master data was highly inconsistent within and across systems. Differences in encoding conventions complicate the use of out-of-the-box SAP tools for duplicate detection.

The implementation of an unsupervised machine learning model allows duplicate detection without comprehensive (or any) data cleansing on data that may end up being culled or consolidated. This approach is effective for any application in which similar natural language data records need to be grouped together at varying levels of granularity. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
